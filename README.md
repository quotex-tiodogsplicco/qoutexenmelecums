# Quotex Martingale Strategy: A Detailed Guide for Indian Traders

## What is Martingale in Quotex?

The Martingale strategy is a high-risk trading strategy that involves
doubling your stake after each losing trade, with the aim of recovering
your losses when you eventually win a trade. While it can be tempting
for traders looking to recoup losses quickly, it\'s crucial to proceed
with caution as it can lead to significant financial setbacks.
